# filehandler

This sample project is to store, update and retrieve uploded files.
Before storing a file in mongoDB metadata is extracted and saved in a separate collection.

To test it out run the application and go to: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

No further configuration required.

Cheers,
Piotr
